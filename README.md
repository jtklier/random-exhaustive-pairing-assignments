# random-exhaustive-pairing-assignments
fun challenge to assign pairs (optional trio if odd number) in an exhaustive manner such that no two people get paired consecutively until they've already paired with everyone else

## Expectations
- 2 people per pair (3 for 1 pair if odd number in the group)
- random assignment of pairs
- no duplicate assignments unless all other pairs are assigned (for now - no need to backtrack)
- list of student names (all unique) will be given, up to you to decide how to load them in/accept them (could be loaded in as a file, or parameter to a function, etc. data structure is negotiable as well)

output is flexible as well. For my first attempt, I'll spit out a 2D array of pairing/grouping assignments
